# Sui-Move-Solidity-Metrics-Python-Script
Two Python scripts, one for Sui Move and one for Solidity, for calculating smart contracts code metrics. They provide insights into various aspects of the contract's quality and complexity using the following metrics:
- Total Lines: Counts the total number of lines in the file, including code, comments, and blank lines.
  
- Lines of Code (LOC): Counts only the lines that contain actual code, excluding comments and blank lines.
  
- Comment Lines: Counts the lines that are purely comments, including both single-line (//) and multi-line (/* ... */) comments.
  
- Number of Functions: Counts the functions defined in the contract.
  
- Number of Imports: Counts the number of import statements, indicating dependencies on other modules or libraries.
  
- Number of Structs: Counts the struct definitions in the contract.

- Cyclomatic Complexity (CC): Counts the complexity of the control flow.
